Problem 2: Online Quiz System

Task 2: Algorithm Implementation (Partial Code)

- Write JavaScript functions to generate random questions, display them on the interface,
receive user input, and calculate the score.
- Develop the logic for question randomization without repeating until all questions are
answered.

Requirements:

1. Question Generation:
• Create a pool of 50 questions on various topics (e.g., Science, History, Math).
• Each question should have a unique ID, the question itself, multiple choices (4 options),
and the correct answer.
2. Quiz Interface:
• Design a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
• The interface should display a random question from the pool with multiple-choice
options.
• Users can select an option and submit their answer.
3. Scoring System:
• Implement a scoring system to calculate the user's score based on correct answers.
• Show the user's score after completing the quiz.
4. Logic and Algorithm:
• Develop a JavaScript algorithm to randomly select questions without repeating until all
questions have been answered.
